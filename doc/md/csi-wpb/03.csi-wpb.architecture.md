# Architecture for Flok Solutions

## Infrastructure Overview

The Flok Solutions system will be built on Drupal and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The initial setup will include a single virtual machine (VM) hosting both the Drupal application and the database. As the system scales beyond 10,000 requests per day, the database will be migrated to a managed cloud database service.

### Key Components

- **Drupal**: The core application running on a GCP VM.
- **Database**: Initially hosted on the same VM as Drupal, later migrated to a managed cloud database.
- **GCP VM**: Hosting the Drupal application and initial database.# Architecture for Flok Solutions

## Infrastructure Overview

The Flok Solutions system will be built on Drupal and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The initial setup will include a single virtual machine (VM) hosting both the Drupal application and the database. As the system scales beyond 10,000 requests per day, the database will be migrated to a managed cloud database service.

### Key Components

- **Drupal**: The core application running on a GCP VM.
- **Database**: Initially hosted on the same VM as Drupal, later migrated to a managed cloud database.
- **GCP VM**: Hosting the Drupal application and initial database.
- **Terraform**: Used for infrastructure provisioning.
- **GitHub**: Repository for source code and CI/CD pipeline.
- **GCP Cloud Storage**: For storing daily database backups.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating database backups and other CI/CD tasks.

## Environment Configuration

The system will be deployed in three separate GCP projects corresponding to different environments:

1. **Development Environment**: `csi-wpb-dev`
2. **Testing Environment**: `csi-wpb-tst`
3. **Production Environment**: `csi-wpb-prd`

## Security

- Only SSH (port 22) and HTTPS (port 443) will be open on the VM.
- Regular security audits and updates will be performed to ensure system integrity.

## Backup Strategy

- Daily database backups will be stored in GCP Cloud Storage.
- Backups will be automated using GitHub Actions.

## Secrets Management

- **KeePassXC**: A KeePassXC database will store all the secrets needed to operate the site.
- **Storage**: The KeePassXC database (`kdbx` file) will be stored in a dedicated GitHub project with access restricted to the DevOps personnel.

## Detailed Architecture

### Initial Setup (Before Scaling)

1. **GCP VM Setup**:
   - Create a GCP VM instance in each environment project.
   - Install and configure Drupal on the VM.
   - Install and configure the database on the same VM.

2. **Security Configuration**:
   - Open only SSH and HTTPS ports on the VM.
   - Configure firewall rules accordingly.

3. **Backup Configuration**:
   - Set up GCP Cloud Storage for storing database backups.
   - Configure GitHub Actions to trigger daily backups to Cloud Storage.

### Scaling Setup (After 10,000+ Requests/Day)

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Migrate the database to a managed cloud database service in GCP.
   - Update Drupal configuration to connect to the new database.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Monitor and optimize VM performance.
   - Consider load balancing and additional scaling strategies as needed.

## Terraform Provisioning

Terraform scripts will be used to provision the infrastructure. Below is an example Terraform configuration for setting up the initial environment.

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Migrate the database to a managed cloud database service in GCP.
   - Update Drupal configuration to connect to the new database.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **VM Performance**:
     - Monitor and optimize the performance of the VM.
     - Upgrade to a larger VM with higher specifications and increased RAM to handle higher traffic.
   - **Load Balancer**:
     - Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
     - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
   - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
     - Integrate a CDN to optimize the delivery of static assets.
     - Reduce latency and improve load times for users globally.
   - **Scaling Strategies**:
     - Implement auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic.
     - Regularly review and adjust performance settings as necessary.

## Terraform Provisioning

Terraform scripts will be used to provision the infrastructure. Below is an example Terraform configuration for setting up the initial environment.


## DNS SETUP 

```lua
Gandhi Registrar
  |
  +-- Forward flok.fi to Google Cloud DNS
       |
       +-- flk-all-all (flok.fi zone)
            |
            +-- csi-wpb-prd (solutions.flok.fi zone)
                 |
                 +-- csi-wpb-dev (flk.sol.dev.solutions.flok.fi zone)
                 +-- csi-wpb-tst (flk.sol.tst.solutions.flok.fi zone)
