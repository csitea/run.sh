# Non-Functional Requirements for Csitea Solutions

## Environment Configuration

The system will be deployed in three separate GCP projects corresponding to different environments:

1. **Development Environment**: `csi-wpb-dev`
2. **Testing Environment**: `csi-wpb-tst`
3. **Production Environment**: `csi-wpb-prd`

## Security

- Only SSH (port 22) and HTTPS (port 443) will be open on the VM.
- Regular security audits and updates will be performed to ensure system integrity.

## Backup Strategy

- Daily database backups will be stored in GCP Cloud Storage.
- Backups will be automated using GitHub Actions.

## Secrets Management

- **KeePassXC**: All site operation secrets will be stored in a KeePassXC database. Access is controlled via GitHub, requiring only the exported `GITHUB_TOKEN` for programmatic access.
- **Storage**: The KeePassXC database (`kdbx` file) will be stored in a dedicated GitHub repository with restricted access for DevOps personnel.
- **GitHub Secrets**: Used for GitHub Actions and must always be provisioned by Terraform.
- **GCP Secrets Manager**: Used for GCP infrastructure secrets, also provisioned exclusively through Terraform.

All secrets must always be stored in the KeePassXC database, updated manually or automatically whenever possible.


## Detailed Architecture

### Initial Setup (Before Scaling)

1. **GCP VM Setup**:
   - Create a GCP VM instance in each environment project.
   - Install and configure Drupal on the VM.
   - Install and configure the database on the same VM.

2. **Security Configuration**:
   - Open only SSH and HTTPS ports on the VM.
   - Configure firewall rules accordingly.

3. **Backup Configuration**:
   - Set up GCP Cloud Storage for storing database backups.
   - Configure GitHub Actions to trigger daily backups to Cloud Storage.

### Scaling Setup (After 10,000+ Requests/Day)

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Migrate the database to a managed cloud database service in GCP.
   - Update Drupal configuration to connect to the new database.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **VM Performance**:
     - Monitor and optimize the performance of the VM.
     - Upgrade to a larger VM with higher specifications and increased RAM to handle higher traffic.
   - **Load Balancer**:
     - Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
     - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
   - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
     - Integrate a CDN to optimize the delivery of static assets.
     - Reduce latency and improve load times for users globally.
   - **Scaling Strategies**:
     - Implement auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic.
     - Regularly review and adjust performance settings as necessary.

## DevOps Requirements

1. **Project Checkout**:
   - DevOps personnel should be able to checkout all of the projects with a single command.

2. **Local Development Setup**:
   - DevOps personnel should be able to set up the full local development environment with a single command, provided they have Docker and Bash on their native hosts.

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - DevOps personnel should be able to provision the entire infrastructure with a single command.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a clear path for setting up, managing, and scaling the Csitea Solutions system on GCP using best practices for security, backup, and performance optimization. The inclusion of a secrets management strategy ensures that sensitive information is handled securely and is accessible only to authorized personnel. Additionally, streamlined DevOps processes enable efficient project management, local development setup, and infrastructure provisioning.
