## Application and Stack Documentation

### Core Application

The Flok Solutions system is built using Drupal, an open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP. The application stack and architecture are designed to leverage Drupal's extensibility while incorporating modern front-end and back-end technologies.

### Drupal

- **Language**: PHP
- **Modules**: Drupal's capabilities will be extended by writing custom modules. Existing modules, especially those for Google and LinkedIn sign-up and authentication, will be reused whenever possible.
- **Paid Modules**: Usage of paid modules will be avoided to minimize costs and dependency on third-party solutions.

### Front-End

- **Framework**: Vue.js
  - Vue.js will be used for the client-side UI to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.
  - Integration with Drupal will allow for seamless content management and user interactions.

### APIs

- The application will include several different APIs running on the VM to handle various functions.
- These APIs will be callable from the UI, providing robust and scalable interactions between the front-end and back-end systems.

### Key Components and Technologies

1. **Drupal (PHP)**:
   - Core CMS functionality.
   - Custom modules to extend Drupal capabilities.
   - Integration with third-party authentication (Google, LinkedIn).

2. **Vue.js**:
   - Client-side framework for building a modern, responsive UI.
   - Ensures smooth user interactions and real-time updates.

3. **APIs**:
   - Custom APIs hosted on the VM.
   - Designed for specific functions and callable from the Vue.js UI.
   - Ensures modularity and scalability of application features.

4. **PostgreSQL**:
   - Database management system.
   - Used for storing and managing application data.
   - Ensures data integrity and supports complex queries.

5. **Nginx**:
   - Web server used to serve the application.
   - Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
   - Ensures efficient handling of client requests.

### Development Guidelines

- **Custom Modules**:
  - Develop custom Drupal modules to add required functionalities not available through existing modules.
  - Follow Drupal's best practices for module development.

- **Reusing Modules**:
  - Prioritize reusing existing open-source Drupal modules to implement common features like authentication.
  - Evaluate and select modules based on community support and reliability.

- **Avoid Paid Modules**:
  - Focus on open-source and community-supported modules.
  - Avoid dependency on paid modules to keep the project cost-effective and maintainable.

- **Vue.js Integration**:
  - Integrate Vue.js with Drupal to enhance the user interface.
  - Use Vue.js components to create dynamic and interactive front-end features.

- **API Development**:
  - Develop RESTful APIs to handle various back-end functionalities.
  - Ensure APIs are well-documented and secure.
  - Optimize APIs for performance and scalability.

- **PostgreSQL Configuration**:
  - Use PostgreSQL 16 as the database management system.
  - Configure PostgreSQL to use md5 authentication and listen on localhost.
  - Change the default port to 54321 for added security.

- **Nginx Configuration**:
  - Configure Nginx as the web server for the application.
  - Ensure proper settings for server_names_hash_bucket_size and client_max_body_size.
  - Use Nginx to handle SSL certificates with Certbot.

- **Code Review**:
  - Implement a code review process to ensure code quality and maintainability.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

### Summary

The Flok Solutions system is designed to be a robust and scalable platform using Drupal as the core CMS, extended with custom modules and integrated with a modern Vue.js front-end. The architecture ensures flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and a high-quality user experience by leveraging open-source technologies and best practices.
